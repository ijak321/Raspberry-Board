# Raspberry-Board
This is my project where I attempt to control a self-built boosted board with a raspberry pi. Ideally, I would like to use my phone as a remote but we'll see where that goes. 
General Project Path:
1) Program my Raspberry pi 2.0 to be able to control motor funcitons. 
  -includes accelerate, brake, rpm check, lock, (speed check?)
2) Enable my pi to connect to my iphone via bluetooth connection or any other connection, wired or wireless. 
3) Design and develop an app that displays and controls the motor functions.
4) Get the app on my phone
  -May require use of an android phone as opposed to my current iPhone
5) Connect the pi/motor to the board. 
  -board assembly will require parts such as battery, brake, specific wheels, housing, motor, belts.
6) Test and troubleshoot.
